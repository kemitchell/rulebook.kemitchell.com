<h2 id="turns">Take turns.</h2>

When negotiating a written agreement, one side proposes terms, then the sides take turns sending edited copies of the terms until they reach a version they are ready to sign or walk away from the deal.

Each version of the document is called a "markup" or "turn" of the agreement.  The side whose turn it is "has the pen".  Do not "take the pen" without discussing with the other side first.

<h2 id="lawyers-businesspeople">Lawyers talk to lawyers.  Businesspeople talk to businesspeople.</h2>

<p>When lawyers address businesspeople on the other side of a deal, the businessperson's lawyer should be present.  If the lawyers is speaking on a call, the other side’s lawyer should also be on the call.  If the lawyer is sending an e-mail, the other side’s lawyer should be copied.</p>

<h2 id="draft-against-yourself">Don’t draft against yourself.</h2>

When the other side isn't happy with your proposal, or wants to add a new term, have them draft it.  Don't try to guess what they will approve.

<h2 id="put-off">Don’t put off today what you can screw up tomorrow.</h2>

Unless you're absolutely sure that an ill-fitting term won't apply in your deal, don't leave it as-is.

<h2 id="blank-checks">Don’t sign blank checks.</h2>

Beware of contract provisions could turn into obligations to pay unbounded amounts of money, or perform unbounded amounts of services, without your agreement or a clear incentive, like a cost, to stop the other side from demanding as much as they can get.

This is particularly important when one side of the deal is much larger, or has many more resources in a specific area, than the other.  Smaller companies often sell SaaS to much larger companies.  Even between companies of roughly the same size, one side may have many more regulatory compliance resources in a given field than the other.
