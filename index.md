<h2 id="draft-against-yourself">Don’t draft against yourself.</h2>

When the other side isn't happy with your proposal, or wants to add a new term, have them draft it.  Don't try to guess what they will approve.

<h2 id="put-off">Don’t put off today what you can screw up tomorrow.</h2>

Unless you're absolutely sure that an ill-fitting term won't apply in your deal, don't leave it as-is.

<h2 id="blank-checks">Don’t sign blank checks.</h2>

Beware of contract provisions could turn into obligations to pay unbounded amounts of money, or perform unbounded amounts of services, without your agreement or a clear incentive, like a cost, to stop the other side from demanding as much as they can get.

This is particularly important when one side of the deal is much larger, or has many more resources in a specific area, than the other.  Smaller companies often sell SaaS to much larger companies.  Even between companies of roughly the same size, one side may have many more regulatory compliance resources in a given field than the other.
